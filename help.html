<h2>Introduction<h2>

<p>We were inspired by <a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">an XKCD cartoon</a> to ask: can we make a large video 
collection interesting enough so that people keep browsing rather than give up? Many people find choosing in 
large collections difficult.</p>

<p>We are currently evaluating a demonstrator based on metadata from the BBC archives, which uses a similarity 
match between different programmes to suggest related programmes to you. If you have a <a 
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/10/history_of_the_bbc_redux_proje.html">Redux account</a> (BBC 
staff only) you can then watch the videos on your playlist using Redux.</p>

<h2>Instructions<h2>

<p>
Please spend as much or as little time as you like over the next seven days to browse through this video
collection and add programmes that you'd like to watch to your playlist using the <big>[+]</big> link beside
each programme. If you get stuck, click on 'shuffle' to get a new random set of programmes.
</p>
<p>
You can use this application as many times as you want during the course of the week. You can
access the playlist you make until the end of the NoTube project (March 2012). See the <a
href="help.html">help</a> for more information about how you can use the playlist.
